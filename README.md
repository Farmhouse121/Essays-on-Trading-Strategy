# Essays on Trading Strategy
Here I am collecting the scripts I have used to prepare my book <em>Essays on Trading Strategy</em> and to support my other writing, such as that in Wilmott Magazine that overlaps with the work for the book. Those for the book are mostly originally written either as Python notebooks for Google's (Colab)[https://colab.research.google.com] system, or as Wolfram Language scripts for their (Mathematica)[https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/] system.
